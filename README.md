# Predict-Employee-Turnover


##Embracing the potential of machine learning to tackle a challenge faced by many organizations: employee turnover. Here's a glimpse into my recent model development journey:


1. Data Preparation: Setting the Foundation
   
Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming data to ensure its quality and accuracy, addressing missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering patterns and relationships within the data, identifying key factors potentially influencing employee turnover, such as tenure, salary, performance, and engagement.


3. Modeling the Dynamics of Retention:
   
Logistic Regression: Employing this model to predict the probability of employee turnover based on identified factors.
Random Forest Classifier: Utilizing this model for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and capture complex interactions between variables.


5. Optimizing for Precision:
   
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning model parameters to enhance performance, identifying the optimal settings for each model to achieve the most accurate predictions.


Key Takeaways:

Machine learning models can effectively predict employee turnover, providing valuable insights for proactive retention strategies. Utilizing model predictions to target retention efforts towards employees at higher risk of leaving and Focus efforts on areas that have the greatest impact on retention.
